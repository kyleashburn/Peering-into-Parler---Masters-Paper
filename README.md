# Peering-into-Parler---Masters-Paper
Repo for Code, Topic Models, and PyLDAVis from Masters Paper
This repository contains the code used in my masters paper. I've kept my steps seperated in different IPYNBs to make it easier to keep track of which was doing what and to aid future reserachers in looking at my work.
While I considered cleaning up my code to make it more presentable, I realized that could be feeding into ideas that code is supposed to be perfect before people can see it. Thus, I'm putting it up as is in the hopes it will help others feel they can tackle computational methods.
