# Peering-into-Parler---Masters-Paper
This repository contains the code used for my masters paper. I've kept my steps seperated in different IPYNBs to make it easier to keep track of which was doing what and to aid future reserachers in looking at my work.
While I considered cleaning up my code to make it more presentable, I realized that could be feeding into ideas that code is supposed to be perfect before people can see it. Thus, I'm putting it up as is in the hopes it will help others feel they can tackle computational methods.

In terms of what can be found in this repo, I have the json fils which contain result sets from my steps. I also have a folder containing all of my topic models and my PyLDAVis visualizations for each of them. Finally, I have all of the IPYNBs associated with this work. INSERT ORDER TO LOOK AT THEM IN
